# ModernWarfareBugs
Repo to keep track of bugs in Modern Warfare (2019)

# List of items to verify
* Wallbreaching with barrier feild upgrade and drone piolet feild upgrade (When attempting this I was able to push the drone out of bounds but not my player, more testing is needed to verify)
* Wallbreaching with care package (tried for a few hours and was unable to get it to work, however, I was informed it still works so I will try to verify it again)

# List of items to find more info on
* It is still possible to have your camera stay put when you die instead of spectating someone, it seems this happens much less often now but it does still happen. I am trying to find out exactly what causes it.
